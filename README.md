This is a simple frontend react app with washers shop.
All data is provided manually in App.js.

## Possible improvements
1. When one washer is selected all other ones can be "unselected".
2. Data can be loaded from a separate location in order not to bloat the App.js file.
3. Below the washers list a "Load more" button could be added that will load the washers data again to simulate data loading from backend.
